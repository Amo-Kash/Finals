# Finals

Destiny Baugh, Freshman
Isaiah Martinez, Junior

In this final project, me and my partner utilized the HTML and CSS languages to make a clothing website. The title of this project is Finesse Clothing Inc. Our goal was to make a homepage, cart and menu feature that takes uses to the other pages which contained various clothing pieces and accessories. Unfortunatly we were not able to complete the cart because the javascript code we developed was broken and was an unfit concept to be implemented.The implemenataion of a banner was unssuccesful ,but the goal was to showcase our unique logo.The positioning of this banner would have given the user an opportunity to become familar with our brand on their intial visit of the home page.
